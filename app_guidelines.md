the source code for this app is located  at `/Users/jorgeflores/Apps/FacturasSimplesApp`
is a swift app that has most of the features required and the most 

initial steps

-- Create an MD file for a summary of the app analysis , lets analyze the source swift ui application to start implementing a ract native application. 

-- provide a descriptioon for each features , IE: how is going to be handled database
-- provide a description about the implementation with the api , 

lets use as referece this
https://k-invoices-api-dev.azurewebsites.net/swagger

also you can find the httpclient implementation for that on 
CatalogSyncService.swift
InvoiceServiceClient.swift


lets built a react native application based on that 
the most important part is replicate the same UI Layout colors and distribution to react native. 
and also the seame functionalities, so please analyze carefully the swift app in order to provide the same functionanility and UI ,
I want to target this app to android and windows. so at the end of the implementation and iterations lets create a deploy documentation 

another important direction is whenever I ask you a new feature you should first of all go and review the swift code becasue is already implemented on the ios APP, 


then you can check screenshots under folder ScreenShots_SwiftApp
